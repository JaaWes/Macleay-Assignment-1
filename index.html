        <h2>The Purpose of Cybersecurity</h2>

        <p>Cybersecurity is the outcome and solution between technology; stakeholders; public perception and
            international policy as a whole. Once we know that cybersecurity is inherently linked to these, we can see
            the bigger narrative and outcome of it. If cybersecurity is not protected or well managed, it can affect all
            these fundamental digital and physical pillars of society. Therefore, if we comprise cybersecurity, we place
            laws, policies and potentially the safety of our planet at risk; because what we can’t control becomes a
            risk. Unfortunately, there are limitations to the implementation of cybersecurity. These limitations can be:
        </p>

        <p>


            o Expenditure or budget



            o Technology and its limitations




            o Timeframes and consumer demands




            o Dependency on system infrastructure – More code and sensitive data to protect.



            Can we keep up? </p>


        <p>Despite these limitations, there is a wide range of dangers associated with the entire world being
            online.</p>


        <p>
            o Governments, banks and primary businesses that once were physical entities are now all digitalised
            forconsumer convenience, leaving highly sensitive information at risk of being hacked.
            o When a cyber system is down a whole nation, security or infrastructure may be breached.
            o The private sector owns the sandbox of support that we utilise in all digital software or hardware.These
            can potentially be connected to corruption and comprised systems.
            o The world wide web is not user-friendly. It is like a spider web that can be used to trap people
            ratherthan to empower people.
            o The digital space is driven by control, not by a democracy of free speech or governance. It is now a war
            between the user and prescribed agenda or motives that are against user first infrastructure.
            o There are no international regulations on cybersecurity, nor is there a metrical guide of governance.

        <h2>Defining Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>Cybersecurity: Protection of information, data, & code, or more specifically, the cyberspace in all its
            facets evolving information systems and networks to protect operations and assets of the individual and
            the collective. It protects against cyber attacks; system failures and or unexpected system shutdowns.
            Without cybersecurity, the vulnerabilities of any digital device, hardware or software can be abused.
            These include devices utilised by governments, businesses and international organisations.
        </p>
        <h>The evolvement of cybersecurity moves when we move.</h>

        <p>In the ’80s and 90’s it was about the protection of data, like emails. Now, it is the protection of our
            very lives as we have become so digitally advanced. A self-replicating program cannot be controlled and
            is, therefore, a threat.

            Computer Viruses. A virus is a forced propagation program. The purpose of the code is to spread its code
            form into other security systems. Otherwise known as a self-replicating program, virus or worm within
            the standard defining terms. If we walk with this metaphor a little, we can see how a computer and its
            programming is based on the human brain & or function. Therefore, a self-replicating program intercepts
            with its DNA into the computer brain to control and take over its pre-programmed original state.
        </p>
        <h2>The First virus – Creeper 1970:</h2>
        <p>Computer systems began being developed in the 1940s-50s, alongside our deepening understanding of human
            psychology. Twenty years later, from this point landmarked a progressive bedrock of the modern digital
            world we now have. An unknown phenomenon in the 1970’s – computer viruses was instead a pioneering
            symbolic act of its right with good merit. Historically, the now infamous creeper virus was a first step
            in the self-replicating program. It would display a creepy message, then proceed to print this message
            and infiltrate the computer system. However, it would link to another computer system and continue all
            over again. In doing so, it would bounce from one system to another not fully installing itself. Later
            adapted versions would fully replicate itself onto the computer system.
            Shortly after the development of the Creeper, the first antivirus was launched called the Reaper, which
            would channel through the net replicating itself, seeking copies of the Creeper and thus logging the
            Creeper out of the system.
            /p>
            <h2>The Morris Worm </h2>
            <p>The Legalisation of the US Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 was a significant act in
                cybersecurity. It resulted in the Morris Worm prosecution. A Harvard graduate Morris encrypted a harmful
                code
                resulting in a shutdown of the early internet. Not only was the Morris Worm single-handedly paving a new
                era
                of global cyber threats, but entered the acceleration of forming malware protection and government
                departments and laws after that. Morris was not only attributed to this nasty worm but also hacked
                into his work computer terminal to cover his tracks. </p>

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>No matter what there will always be a risk to digital infrastructure. And so what does that mean when
                our physical world is being blended with the present digital revolution? When the system webs into
                our bloodstream and wired into our brains, are we aware of the risks at hand? In the next five
                years,self-replicating programs will cohabitate among the interwoven systems that are now solely
                physical
                elements in our environment and bodies. How far are we willing to consent to such a risk? An are we
                willing to take cybersecurity seriously?</p>
